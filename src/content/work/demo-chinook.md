#### Background

The starting point for this project was using the received SQLite .db file to crerate a CRUD app that will allow fictional employees to manage the album stock.

#### What goals?

- Gaining experience with C# and .NET to produce viable server side applications.
- Templating markup with Razor and/or MVC model.
- Working with ORM abstractions rather than raw SQL queries.
- Using VSCode but also learning to install Omnisharp language server and configure .editorconfig in the environment which is an important skill for keeping the coding style consistent with a team's preferences.
- Spicing up work on the design process to look into modern CSS nesting patterns available native without preprocessors.

#### Features

- Basic authentication with email and password being birthday (to allow teacher access, yet making it a little bit unguessable). Passwords are not stored, simple compared against formatted string based on DoB.
- All basic CRUD operations for albums list.
- Simple responsive UI.
- Dedicated logic based on whether the Album or Artist exists in the database, has 0, 1 or more entries per Artist etc.
